meta-REDHAWK-JTNC
=================

The meta-redhawk-jtnc layer depends on meta-redhawk-sdr for the build dependencies, but otherwise has no other dependency against it.  It can currently be installed in parallel with REDHAWK.  This layer has been tested with the `rocko` released of Yocto OpenEmbedded (2.4.x) but may support more recent versions.
